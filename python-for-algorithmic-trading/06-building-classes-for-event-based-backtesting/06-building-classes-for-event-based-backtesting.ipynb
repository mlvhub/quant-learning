    "When it comes to vectorized backtesting, potential shortcomings of the approach are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look-ahead bias: vectorized backtesting is based on the complete data set available and does not take into account that new data arrives incrementally\n",
    "- Simplification: for example, fixed transaction costs cannot be modeled by vectorization, which is mainly based on relative returns. Also, fixed amounts per trade or the non-divisibility of single financial instruments (for example, a share of a stock) cannot be modeled properly\n",
    "- Non-recursiveness: algorithms, embodying trading strategies, might take recurse to state variables over time, like profit and loss up to a certain point in time or similar path-dependent statistics. Vectorization cannot cope with such features"
